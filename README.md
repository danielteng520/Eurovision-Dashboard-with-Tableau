# Eurovision Data Visualization
This repository contains my assignment for **TDS 3401: Data Visualization**. The project uses data from the Eurovision Song Contest (1998-2012) to uncover interesting patterns and insights through Tableau visualizations.

## Project Overview
The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual music competition, primarily featuring European countries. This assignment aims to create an engaging and informative Tableau dashboard that answers specific questions based on the contest data, including:

- **Changes in musical trends over time**
- **Regional competitiveness and number of wins**
- **Factors that contribute to success in the contest**

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from **Eurovision_1998to2012.xlsx**, containing contest details for the period 1998-2012. This data includes country entries, points awarded, and other relevant contest information.

## Objectives
The goals for this visualization include:
1. Crafting a compelling story or question for the dashboard.
2. Selecting suitable data representations (graphs, tables) that clearly communicate the insights.
3. Exploring various comparisons, trends, and factors of success in the Eurovision Song Contest.

## Key Visualizations
The dashboard consists of multiple worksheets answering at least three primary questions:
- How have musical trends evolved over the years?
- Is there evidence of a home-ground advantage?
- Which regions have won the most competitions?

## How to View
1. Download the `.twbx` file from this repository.
2. Open the file in Tableau to explore the dashboard and each worksheet.
